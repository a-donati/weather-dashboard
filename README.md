# weather-dashboard

This project is a simple weather dashboard made with HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, and jQuery. You are able to search for a location using the searchbar to the left of the page which will then display the current weather for the desired location along with the five day forecast. The values displayed are a location's temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and UV index. The location search history is saved in local storage and displayed below the search area.
